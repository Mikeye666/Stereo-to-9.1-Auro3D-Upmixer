# Stereo-to-9.1-Auro3D-Upmixer

This is the repository of my master's thesis project "Real-time Stereo to 9.1 Auro3D upmixer using perceptual band allocation and ambience extraction".


It used dual-band perceptual band allocation (Lee, 2015) and a real-time ambience extraction algorithm modified from (Kraft & ZÃ¶lzer, 2016).


A real-time test system was developed based on the componant of my proposed system with UI tweaks for rating and randomly playbacking test audio samples.


Final version of the Proposed Upmixing System: Ver1.3


Final version of the Test System: Ver1.2
